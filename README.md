# Carbon-Offset-Calculator

This software seeks to answer one question: how many trees do I need to plant in order to offset my personal carbon footprint?

This repository, written in Python, simulates a person's life year by year. It takes in parameters, e.g. how many trees planted each year, and calculates a person's carbon footprint year over year. Once all the simulating is done, it shows a dandy graph that shows a person's carbon footprint over time. This simulation accounts for how many years it takes for a tree to mature, the mortality rate of trees, and more. 

Naturally, this software is only an estimation. It is based on my research, as well as data from The Arbor Day Foundation, which is a non-profit tree planting organization. 

Additionally, it is worth acknowledging that planting a tree is not a perfect solution. While tree's are great carbon sponges, they aren't pernament. For example, if one of your trees catch fire, then a significant amount of the carbon the tree absorbed would be put back into the atmosphere. Nonetheless, planting a tree is better than nothing.
